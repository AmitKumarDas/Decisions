### Learn you some business
How often have you heard about a business which is low margin one. All like high margin businesses. 
Infact why should one invest in a low margin business.

Well, have you heard of Capital Turnover? **Turnover and Mergin are opposites.** 
- `Capital Turnover = Revenues/Capital`
- `Margin = Profit/Revenues`

What if we multiply above? We get `Profit/Capital` i.e. Return On Invested Capital

To sum it up, we should love a high ROIC business. In other words, even if the business is a low margin one and yet has
a high `Capital Turnover`, it should turn us on.
