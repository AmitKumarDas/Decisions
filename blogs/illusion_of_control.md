“The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance – it is the illusion of knowledge.” ~ Daniel Boorstin

The Art of Thinking Clearly is a nice book from Rolf Dobelli. In one chapter, Dobelli shares a couple of instances:
> Every day, shortly before nine o’clock, a man with a red hat stands in a square and begins to wave his cap 
around wildly. After five minutes he disappears. One day, a policeman comes up to him and asks: _What are you 
doing? I'm keeping the giraffes away. But there aren't any giraffes here. Well, I must be doing a good job, then._

Trying to increase your confidence by **gathering information that is supposedly unknown to most others** really only 
**makes you more comfortable with your decisions, not better at them**, and is generally an unproductive use of your 
limited time. In the world of technology this applies to testing i.e. _addition of more and more tests does not imply
absence of bugs_. Speaking of current trend, prevelance of open source software is a testimony to this hypothesis.

In the world of investments, listen to what Safal Niveshak has to say: "Business related information is highly 
perishable. Economic conditions change, industries are transformed, and business results are volatile. The effort 
to acquire current, let alone complete information is never-ending. Meanwhile, other market participants are also 
gathering and updating information, thereby diminishing any investor's informational advantage.

Investors frequently benefit from making investment decisions with less than perfect knowledge and are well rewarded 
for bearing the risk of uncertainty. The time other investors spend delving into the last unanswered detail may cost 
them the chance to buy in at prices so low that they offer a margin of safety despite the incomplete information."
