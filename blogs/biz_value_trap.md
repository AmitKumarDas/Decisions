In stock market, we often get adviced to avoid value traps. How do I judge if a business is value trap
versus a good one that is offered below its value by the eccentric Mr. Market? Most of us understand the
characteristics of a good business which is:

- _no debt_, 
- _negative working capital_, & 
- _being cash rich_

However, a value trap is more often an offshoot from a seemingly good business. How do we find such a trap
then? I will try to post the interview of a investor cum professor & a investor cum blogger to clear the air.

This is extracted from Prof. Sanjay Bakshi's interview with SafalNiveshak.

Let’s look at this hypothetical stock. It has substantial cash on its balance sheet. It has no debt or 
other liabilities which have a prior claim on that cash. It also has an operating business. But the 
market value of the company is less than cash assets alone. This is a _**cash bargain**_. Many of my 
students when they look at this thing, they say, _“My God, this is not possible! How is it possible that
in a market that is supposed to be efficient, you are seeing a stock selling below cash?”_ They want to 
_**buy it based on their first conclusions**_. But under what circumstances would that first conclusion be
wrong? You see, the mind does not automatically think in those terms. _**The mind, instead, latches on to the 
first conclusion**_, which, in this case, is that the stock is ridiculously cheap, so it must be bought.
Now, I tell my students, _**“Let’s force ourselves to think of three reasons why buying such a stock would be a
mistake.”**_

They have to come up with three reasons. Why three? Why not one? Why not four? Well, three is good enough!
The idea is to force yourself to come up with multiple reasons that go contrary to your first conclusion and
only when you force your mind to come up with three, will _**it generate three very good reasons**_. So what 
are the three reasons for “not” buying that cash bargain based on your first conclusion that it’s cheap?

Reason 1: Cash burn: Maybe the operating business _**is losing money**_ and cash will be dissipated away in 
just a few quarters. This is what happened to dotcoms after that bubble burst. Many companies had _**raised 
cash in the IPO bubble**_ and now that the _**bubble had burst they were selling below cash**_. There _**wasn’t 
any debt because no sane banker would lend such startups any money**_. But the operating businesses were burning 
cash at a rapid pace and it was only a matter of time when the cash would disappear. Buying such 
“cash bargains” when they became available in the stock market, would have been a _mistake_.

Reason 2: Corporate misgovernance: What if the promoters of the company are well-entrenched because they have
a 70% stake, and they have _**no intention of sharing the wealth**_ of the company with the _minority investors_? 
They pay _**no dividends**_, and will _**never liquidate the company**_. What’s such a company worth? This company 
is what Benjamin Graham once called the _"frozen corporation"_ which will never be liquidated and will never pay 
a dividend. Then _**what the company owns is irrelevant for minority investors**_, isn’t it? So just because the stock
is selling below cash assets alone doesn’t necessarily make it an attractive investment.

Reason 3: Bubble market: When the markets are frothy, people desperately looking for value gravitate towards
“cash bargains” because they are evidently cheap. Well, they are almost certainly making a mistake because
history shows that when the markets decline, these stocks will also decline, often by much more than the market.
So, _**now we have three very good reasons**_ for not buying the stock and we can now have a much more _**balanced
debate**_ about whether or not we should buy it. We have trained ourselves out of first conclusion bias. And you have
to do this automatically, like breathing. _**To question your first conclusions by thinking forcefully about why they
could be wrong – by doing this over and over again**_ – you will become a better thinker, decision maker, and investor."
