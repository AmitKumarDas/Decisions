The moment a sperm enters the human egg, the doors are slammed shut. Our brain is like a human egg. As soon as an
idea impregnates the human mind, it closes its doors for other ideas. The _**first explanation**_ that comes to mind makes
us _**blind towards other more plausible possibilities**_. Unfortunately, in our complex world, the first conclusions are
almost always deceiving. __ Safal Niveshak & Probably Others

Vishal explains the _**why part**_ very lucidly. He says, "Well, evolution has wired our brains in such a manner that
it avoids anything which depletes the energy. And nothing consumes more energy in the brain cells than an
unresolved observation. _**Unexplained events are calorie hoggers for our grey matter**_. Our genes are programmed
to conserve energy and embracing the first answer to any problem is a very effective strategy. Thatâ€™s why we all
jump to conclusions by making inferences and assumptions in most things we do in life, and it often helps us."
