The moment a sperm enters the human egg, the doors are slammed shut. Our brain is like a human egg. As soon as an
idea impregnates the human mind, it closes its doors for other ideas. The _**first explanation**_ that comes to mind makes
us _**blind towards other more plausible possibilities**_. Unfortunately, in our complex world, the first conclusions are
almost always deceiving. __ Safal Niveshak & Probably Others

Vishal explains the _**why part**_ very lucidly. He says, "Well, evolution has wired our brains in such a manner that
it avoids anything which depletes the energy. And nothing consumes more energy in the brain cells than an
unresolved observation. _**Unexplained events are calorie hoggers for our grey matter**_. Our genes are programmed
to conserve energy and embracing the first answer to any problem is a very effective strategy. That’s why we all
jump to conclusions by making inferences and assumptions in most things we do in life, and it often helps us."

Let me try to draw an analogy with respect to my day job which is _implementing logic for a problem statement_. How
often I would have concluded on a specific way, approach, or pattern the moment my brain is presented with a 
problem statement. These specific approaches would surely been a result of my past experiences; which in other words
would have been the least calorie hogger to my brain & hence would have popped out as the only solution.
