### Motivation
Storage as an infrastructure requires proper maintainenance to serve the needs of higher order applications. We shall try to 
cover these activities as Day 2 operations. Day 2 as the name suggests are the activites that a storage admin would like to 
perform after initial storage related provisioning is done and applications have started to make use this storage.

### UseCases
#### Add or Remove Disks
>> As a storage admin I would like to add new disks to increase capacity or replace bad disks with new ones to keep storage up
and running without any side-effects.
