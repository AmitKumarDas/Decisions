### Code Review - Part 2
This article is part of a series of blogs related to code review. I keep writing down the source code of my own project or
one from some open source community and start providing the review comments as code level commments. This helps me in avoiding
any first conclusion bias(-es) I might form when I look at the code for the first time. This also helps me to think by putting
on a user's hat and write down the points to make this code simple.
