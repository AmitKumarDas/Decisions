### Rough
When you go great lengths to preserve the coolness of UNIX pipes by managing using golang; exposed via a yaml; that in turn 
becomes a RunBook. What you get is a new tool for shell scripters without getting into the messiness of writing shell scripts. 
Do not get me wrong here. All love the unix philosophy & love its pipes which brings this philosophy to a working reality. This 
new idea / tool lets you to reuse your shell command tricks without getting burning your fingers in shell scripts.
