```go
// One may write either
	if glog.V(2) { glog.Info("log this") }
// or
	glog.V(2).Info("log this")
```

### How is above even possible? 
- Can you think of how to implement similar stuff?

### Solution
- Refer - https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/master/glog.go

```go
type Verbose bool
```
```go
// The second form is shorter but the first is cheaper if logging is off because it does
// not evaluate its arguments.
//
// Whether an individual call to V generates a log record depends on the setting of
// the -v and --vmodule flags; both are off by default. If the level in the call to
// V is at least the value of -v, or of -vmodule for the source file containing the
// call, the V call will log.
func V(level Level) Verbose {
	// This function tries hard to be cheap unless there's work to do.
	// The fast path is two atomic loads and compares.

	// Here is a cheap but safe test to see if V logging is enabled globally.
	if logging.verbosity.get() >= level {
		return Verbose(true)
	}

	// It's off globally but it vmodule may still be set.
	// Here is another cheap but safe test to see if vmodule is enabled.
	if atomic.LoadInt32(&logging.filterLength) > 0 {
		// Now we need a proper lock to use the logging structure. The pcs field
		// is shared so we must lock before accessing it. This is fairly expensive,
		// but if V logging is enabled we're slow anyway.
		logging.mu.Lock()
		defer logging.mu.Unlock()
		if runtime.Callers(2, logging.pcs[:]) == 0 {
			return Verbose(false)
		}
		v, ok := logging.vmap[logging.pcs[0]]
		if !ok {
			v = logging.setV(logging.pcs[0])
		}
		return Verbose(v >= level)
	}
	return Verbose(false)
}

// Info is equivalent to the global Info function, guarded by the value of v.
// See the documentation of V for usage.
func (v Verbose) Info(args ...interface{}) {
	if v {
		logging.print(infoLog, args...)
	}
}
```
