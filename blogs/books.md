Mark Twain once said, "**_The man who does not read great books has no particular advantage over the man 
who cannot read them._**"

Top on the list is a book called **_Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds_** by 
**_Charles Mackay_**, written in 1841. Why is this book still around? Why did Andrew Tobias, a 
respected American author say that "if you read no more of this book than the first hundred pages – 
on money mania – it will be worth many times its purchase?" __ Prof. Sanjay Bakshi

Why is it such an important book? Because it tells you a lot about human nature. It describes how 
people can go mad during certain periods.
