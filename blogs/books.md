Top on the list is a book called **_Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds_** by 
**_Charles Mackay_**, written in 1841. Why is this book still around? Why did Andrew Tobias, a 
respected American author say that "if you read no more of this book than the first hundred pages – 
on money mania – it will be worth many times its purchase?" __ Prof. Sanjay Bakshi
