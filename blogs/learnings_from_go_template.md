The first time I chanced to understand a go template file was when I was reviewing a helm chart. The subset of language 
constructs in the template was simply amazing. The thing that stood out was the pipes & the ease of adding a custom function.

Below are some of the learnings & ideas I got while coding against go templating:

1/ Passing values to a template ?
2/ Can these values be mutated while template is being executed ?
3/ Can we build a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based out of go template ?
