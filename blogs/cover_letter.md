I have elaborated my current profile which correlates my area of interest & provides a fair glimpse of my personality.
I specialize in designing, building solutions as well as developer tools. However, I firmly believe above skills does not
have a profound impact until those are used, understood, apprecitated & criticized by a larger community. Hence my belief in
_OpenSource Programming_. I conclude by accepting the fact that any solution can stand the test of time if & only if it is 
simple.

Currently designing operators and e2e tooling around block file systems [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) using Kubernetes.

### My hands on
As part of implementing software pieces, I use a variety of programming languages, libraries, tools as & when applicable. I 
am fascinated by functional languages and the novelty they provide by segregating the concerns from the domain logic. I have 
been associated with following programming languages:

- GO (**_current_**)
- Java, Groovy, Python, JavaScript, VB.Net, C# (_past lives_)

### When I wear my devops hat
As an architect in my current place of work, I have been coding reconcile operators, workflow tooling required for the world
of _Devops_ and _Automation Everywhere_. Below are my hands-on that try to **convey my position** w.r.t automation 
everywhere, which is:
- 1/ either create or 
- 2/ exploit an existing tool

Here are some links related to a automation tool that I was building back in the year 2016:
