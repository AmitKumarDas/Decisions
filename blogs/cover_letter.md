I have elaborated my current profile which correlates my area of interest & provides a fair glimpse of my personality.
I specialize in designing, building solutions as well as developer tools. However, I firmly believe above skills does not
have a profound impact until those are used, understood, apprecitated & criticized by a larger community. Hence my belief in
_OpenSource Programming_. I conclude by accepting the fact that any solution can stand the test of time if & only if it is 
simple.

Currently designing operators and e2e tooling around block file systems [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) using Kubernetes.

### My hands on
As part of implementing software pieces, I use a variety of programming languages, libraries, tools as & when applicable. I 
am fascinated by functional languages and the novelty they provide by segregating the concerns from the domain logic. I have 
been associated with following programming languages:

- GO (**_current_**)
- Java, Groovy, Python, JavaScript, VB.Net, C# (_past lives_)

### My contributions
As an architect in my current place of work, I have been coding reconcile operators, workflow tooling required for the world
of _fileystems_. 

Below are my hands-on that try to **convey my position** w.r.t automation, which is (1) either create or (2) exploit an 
existing tool.

Here are some links related to an automation tool that I built back in the year 2016:
- [A groovy based DSL](https://github.com/cloudbytestorage/automation-core/blob/master/README.md)
- [Lessons Learnt](https://github.com/cloudbytestorage/automation-core/blob/master/touchstone/DesignThoughts/My%20Final%20Thoughts.md)

I would suggest to go through the commit history of below projects, which reflect **my programming style**:
- [Contributions to OpenEBS](https://github.com/openebs/maya)
- [Litmus](https://github.com/openebs/litmus)
- [Building Automation DSL](https://github.com/AmitKumarDas/automation-core)
- Contributions to OpenStack - Unfortunately, cloudbyte cinder plugin driver has been removed ;)
