The winds shift so quickly in the business world that even when you feel invincible, you are still vulnerable –
you just don’t know it. If you spend your life extracting as much value from people when you can, do not be
surprised when people don’t want to help you when you get knocked down. _**Some of the most successful people are
also the most generous.**_ They always leave something on the table for the other side. They do
this even when they have maximum leverage. They do this because they know what it is like to be on the other
side of the table. They do this because they _**believe in fairness more than winning**_. 

The key is realizing that in a world where most projects are not zero sum, how things are negotiated upfront
sets the stage for how the relationship will play out in the long term.   __ Craig Shapiro
