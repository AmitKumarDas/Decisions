### Understand & Derive
> Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style (indicated by “|”) where all line breaks are 
significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the folded style (denoted by “>”) where each line break is folded 
to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented line. __ YAML SPECS
