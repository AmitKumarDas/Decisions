> When you grow up you, tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your 
life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls 
too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very
limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and 
that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that 
were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can 
build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never 
be the same again.

> The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, 
you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change 
it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off
this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus 
embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.

> I think that’s very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll 
want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of 
ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again."
