> When you grow up you, tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your 
life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls 
too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very
limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and 
that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that 
were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can 
build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never 
be the same again.
