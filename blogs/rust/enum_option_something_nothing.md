```rust
// Define a type by enumerating its possible values. 
// How an enum can encode meaning along with data. 
//
// A useful enum, called Option, which expresses that 
// a value can be either something or nothing. 
//
// How pattern matching in the match expression makes 
// it easy to run different code for different values
// of an enum. It is kind of map over each enum values.
//
// How the if let construct is another convenient and
// concise idiom available to you to **handle** enums in 
// your code.
//
// Rustâ€™s enums are most similar to **algebraic data types**
// in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.
