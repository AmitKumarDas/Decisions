### What if you programmed ABC as XYZ
Welcome back! Have you often come out with ideas that you think now is better than the earlier solution you implemented to a
given problem statement. On the hindsight we are slaves to our first conclusion bias. Our brains shut off any other 
possibilities once it gets attracted to a particular solution. Human brains are wired to optimise its use of energy into 
approving an idea to being a great solution indeed stamping it as the only solution possible. It often relies on past 
experiences, current mood, ongoing interactions with others, and so many other factors both past & present that are not within
one's control.

### How to overcome then?
This is an issue which can be solved in an elegant manner, which is write down all your incoming ideas. Start putting down 
your loved ideas and then start disconfirming them. Tip: Use your notepad.
- Write down your belief versus three possibilities that stands against this belief
- Being intelligent on the topic versus applying wisdom from across the subject
- Calculating answers versus considering possibilities
- You own discovery as an evidence versus poking others to find loopholes in this discovery
- Something you want to be true versus being un-biased

#### Programming conclusions and their disconfirming alternatives
- Plain logic of switch case statement vs.
  - Case to _**specific strategies**_
  - Note - A specific strategy can be a higher order function
  - Note - A specific strategy can be an interface based abstraction
- Plain function or method implementing a switch statement vs.
  - Function making use of switch is a higher order function that _**returns a strategy**_
  - Function making use of switch is an interface based abstraction
- Think in terms of interfaces vs.
  - Think in terms of higher order functions
- Implements structures vs.
  - Implement functions abiding to a higher order function
- Implement function with arguments vs.
  - Implement a structure with above arguments as properties
- Structures embedding and / or composing other structures vs.
  - Structs composing interfaces
- Structs composing interfaces vs.
  - Structs composing higher order functions
- Polymorphism leads to thinking in terms of interface vs.
  - Polymorphism leads to thinking in terms of functional strategies
- Think in terms of flag vs.
  - Think in terms of ENV that can be used for flags
- Think ENV vs.
  - Think exposing a command that can be invoked at runtime
- Use yaml or json as a config vs.
  - Use a struct composed of higher order functions as a config
- Split apis, interfaces, and services across namespaces vs.
  - Keep all of them under one namespace
- Make use of versioned namespaces vs.
  - Make more use of strategies & higher order functions
